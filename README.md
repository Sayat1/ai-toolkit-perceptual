# AI Toolkit - Perceptual Anchoring Fork

A fork of [AI Toolkit by Ostris](https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit) that adds **perceptual anchoring** to LoRA training. The idea is straightforward: instead of training only on per-pixel match against your dataset, you also tell the LoRA to match specific properties of those images using pre-trained vision models. There's an anchor for depth (the geometric structure of a scene), one for facial identity, one for body proportions, and a face-suppression option for when you don't want faces baked in at all. The depth anchor is the most useful one in practice. It lets the LoRA pick up the shapes in your dataset without locking in the colors, textures, or lighting, so trained models stay sharper on small datasets and generalize better to new prompts.

**Supported models:** SDXL, FLUX.2 Klein 9B

## Perceptual Anchoring

The standard LoRA training loss is per-pixel MSE in latent space. It tells the model "match this exact image." On small datasets that turns into a strong instruction to memorize, which is why you often see washed-out colors, baked-in lighting, and "burn-in" (stippling, JPEG ghosts) showing up in every generation.

Perceptual anchors give the LoRA more targeted guidance. Each one is a frozen vision model that scores a single property of the generated image, like its depth or its facial identity, and the LoRA gets rewarded for matching the training images on that property alone. You pick which properties matter for what you're training.

### Depth-Consistency Anchor

Tells the LoRA to keep the geometric structure of the training images while ignoring everything else. It separates "what's in the scene" (which is the LoRA's job) from "how it looks in this particular photo" (which can be left to the model's prior). Useful for:

- **Subject LoRAs that generalize.** The model learns the subject's shape and pose without baking in the outfit, lighting, or backdrop of each training photo.
- **Style transfer** that keeps scene composition but changes appearance.
- **Reducing texture burn-in and stippling** on small datasets. Depth doesn't reinforce per-pixel artifacts, so fine-detail memorization slows down a lot.

Powered by Depth-Anything-V2 (Small by default; Base or Large can be selected for stronger geometry).

**Quick start:**

```yaml
depth_consistency:
  loss_weight: 0.1                       # default; 0 disables
  model_id: depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small-hf
  mask_source: subject                   # 'none' | 'subject' | 'body'
  loss_min_t: 0.0
  loss_max_t: 1.0
  preview_every: 100
```

The default of `0.1` is calibrated for **DA2-Small** (the default perceptor). If you switch to **DA2-Large**, drop the weight to around `0.001`, since the larger model produces much higher-magnitude gradients and `0.1` will overpower the diffusion loss. **DA2-Base** sits between the two; start at `0.01` and tune from there. If outputs look washed-out, over-smoothed, or the LoRA seems to be ignoring color and texture, the depth weight is too high. Halve it and retry.

**Per-dataset overrides** (handy when different folders need different strengths):

```yaml
datasets:
  - folder_path: /path/to/portraits
    depth_loss_weight: 0.2               # stronger structure on portraits
    depth_loss_min_t: 0.5                # only fire on noisy timesteps for this set
```

Ground-truth depth maps are cached automatically at job start, so the anchor adds no per-step preprocessing cost once training begins.

**Loss splitting (strongly recommended for most cases).** When the diffusion loss and depth anchor pull in different directions, having them fire on alternating optimizer steps instead of competing every step turns out to work better than running them together for almost every workflow we've tested. Set it on the dataset:

```yaml
datasets:
  - folder_path: /path/to/data
    loss_split: diffusion_depth
```

This separates structure-learning (depth) from appearance-learning (diffusion) into distinct optimizer steps. In practice it acts as a strong implicit regularizer against burn-in: fine-texture parameters update much more slowly than coarse-structure parameters, since the two losses only really agree on the latter. Try it before tuning weights or other knobs.

### Identity Anchor (ArcFace)
Keeps the trained subject's face recognizable across poses, expressions, and lighting. Useful when you're training on diverse appearances of the same person and the diffusion loss alone isn't enough to lock in identity. Recommended weight: **0.01 to 0.1**.

### Body Proportion Anchor (ViTPose)
Keeps body proportions (limb lengths, torso ratio) consistent with the training images. Useful for full-body subject LoRAs where the body shape should stay recognizable across generated poses. Recommended weight: **0.1 to 0.2**.

### Face Suppression
The inverse of the identity anchor: it tells the LoRA to *ignore* faces. The diffusion loss is downweighted (or zeroed) inside detected face regions, so the model doesn't learn to reproduce the faces in your dataset. Use this when training a style or clothing LoRA on a dataset that happens to contain people, and you want the style or outfit but not the faces.

Set `face_id.face_suppression_weight` between `0` (off) and `1` (full suppression). Per-dataset overrides are supported.

### Quick-start config

```yaml
depth_consistency:
  loss_weight: 0.1                       # primary anchor (DA2-Small default; use 0.001 for DA2-Large)
face_id:
  identity_loss_weight: 0.1              # secondary
  body_proportion_loss_weight: 0.1       # secondary
  face_suppression_weight: 0.5           # optional
  identity_metrics: true                 # log id_sim without applying loss
```

Per-dataset overrides let you tune each anchor for the dataset's content:

```yaml
datasets:
  - folder_path: /path/to/portraits
    depth_loss_weight: 0.2               # stronger structure on portraits
    identity_loss_weight: 0.1            # stronger face on close-ups
  - folder_path: /path/to/fullbody
    body_proportion_loss_weight: 0.15    # preserve body shape
    face_suppression_weight: 1.0         # full suppression, don't learn faces
```

See `config/examples/train_lora_flux_identity_24gb.yaml` for a complete example.

## Auto-Masking

Splits each training image into regions (body, clothing, and subject = body ∪ clothing) so different parts of the image can be weighted differently in the loss. Useful for:

- **Subject LoRAs** that should focus on the person, not the background. Set the background weight low and the body weight high.
- **Clothing LoRAs** that should learn outfit details while ignoring face and body.
- **Letting the depth anchor focus on the subject** instead of computing depth-consistency over the whole image, where most of the frame is usually background you don't care about.

Masks are generated per image at job start and cached.

```yaml
subject_mask:
  enabled: true
  body_close_radius: 5
```

```yaml
datasets:
  - folder_path: /path/to/data
    background_loss_weight: 0.3
    clothing_loss_weight: 0.7
    body_loss_weight: 1.0
    perceptual_restrict_to_body: true    # restrict perceptual anchors to body region
```

The depth anchor picks which mask it uses via `depth_consistency.mask_source` (`subject`, `body`, or `none`).

QC tiles for visual inspection are saved at job start and can be regenerated from the dataset-tools UI.

## Reg Dataset Semantics

Reg datasets (`is_reg: true`) work the classic Dreambooth way: they're prior-preservation samples that train the model on generic non-subject images alongside your subject samples, so it doesn't forget how to make non-subject content while it's learning the subject. In this fork, reg semantics are tightened up:

- **All perceptual anchors are turned off on reg samples.** Only the diffusion loss fires, scaled by `train.reg_weight`.
- **Subject conditioning is stripped.** No clip-image or trigger-word injection.

The effect is that reg samples teach the model "produce sharp prior-distribution images" without contaminating any of the subject-specific anchors. The 50/50 reg/train alternation runs at the optimizer-step level, so the gradient stays clean under any accumulation setting. `train.reg_weight` (default `1.0`) controls how strongly reg pulls vs. train.

## Training Metrics

Every active loss is logged so you can see during a run whether each anchor is doing its job. The training UI shows live charts plus per-sample tooltips on each point (which images drove the loss this step).

| Metric | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| `diffusion_loss` | How well the model is matching training images per-pixel. Watch for it bottoming out, which usually means memorization. |
| `diffusion_loss_tNN` | Diffusion loss broken down by timestep band (`t00` through `t90`). Useful for spotting whether low-noise or high-noise timesteps are dominating. |
| `depth_consistency_loss` | How well the predicted geometry matches the training images. Should fall steadily; if it goes flat, the depth anchor isn't converging. |
| `depth_loss_tNN` | Depth loss per timestep band. |
| `id_sim` | Face cosine similarity (higher is better). Set `face_id.identity_metrics: true` to log this without applying the loss. |
| `id_sim_tNN` | Per-timestep face similarity. |
| `body_proportion_loss` | Pose-proportion error. |
| `grad_norm` | Total gradient magnitude post-clip. Spikes usually mean a loss explosion. |
| `grad_norm_diffusion`, `grad_norm_depth`, `grad_cos_diff_depth` | Optional gradient-cosine diagnostic. See below. |

**Gradient-cosine diagnostic.** When you suspect two anchors are pulling in opposite directions, this measures how aligned their gradients are. Cosine near +1 means they reinforce each other, near 0 means they're independent, negative means they're fighting. Off by default; enable with `train.gradient_cosine_log_every: 50`.

## Training Previews

Visual previews are saved during training so you can see at a glance what each anchor is responding to.

| Directory | What you see |
|---|---|
| `depth_previews/` | Side-by-side comparison of GT image, GT depth, predicted image, and predicted depth. Annotated with timestep and depth-loss value so you can scroll through training and watch the geometry converge. |
| `id_previews/` | What the identity anchor is seeing: the face crop being scored, alongside the noisy input and the model's x0 prediction, with the cosine similarity overlaid. |
| `body_previews/` | Skeleton overlays for reference vs. predicted poses. |
| `subject_mask_previews/` | Mask QC: each image with its body, clothing, and subject masks overlaid, generated once at job start. |

## Dataset-Tools UI

Before training, the web UI provides preflight passes that prepare the cached data each anchor needs:

- **Depth preflight.** Runs depth estimation across the dataset and shows visual QC tiles so you can spot bad masks or odd crops before they cost you a training run.
- **Subject-mask preflight.** Generates and caches the body, clothing, and subject masks with overlays for review.
- **Face-detection preflight.** Caches face bounding boxes and identity embeddings.

All three run as non-blocking background jobs. Start them and come back when they're done.

The `scripts/sample_dataset.py` utility builds a smaller dataset directory by sampling N random images (with their captions) from a larger source. Useful for building reg sets, running ablations, or making smoke-test datasets without copying everything.

## Example: Handsome Squidward (single-image LoRA)

A working example of depth-anchored fine-tuning on a character that isn't well represented in the base model, with a **one-image dataset**.

**The setup.** Handsome Squidward is a side character from a single SpongeBob SquarePants episode. Flux 2 Klein 9B doesn't reliably reproduce him out of the box; prompts default to regular Squidward or a confused human-squid hybrid. We trained a LoRA on a single official illustration to teach the model what he looks like, then tested whether the trained LoRA could generalize to angles and contexts that don't exist anywhere in the source material.

**The dataset.** One image, one caption.

```
examples/squidward/dataset/
├── 1.webp     # single training image
└── 1.txt      # caption
```

The caption: *"a cartoon illustration of handsome squidward. he is standing confidently with his arms flared and his tentacle-hands on his hips. he is wearing a tight yellow shirt with a brown belt and gold buckle. he has four legs, two on each side close together. his legs are spread apart. there is a logo at the bottom of the frame."*

**The config.** [`examples/squidward/config.yaml`](examples/squidward/config.yaml) is the full training config. Key settings:

- **Network:** LoKr, linear/alpha 32, conv/alpha 16, full-rank, factor 8.
- **Steps:** 1200, batch size 1, gradient accumulation 2.
- **Dataset:** 1 image, `num_repeats: 50`.
- **Depth anchor:** `loss_weight: 0.005`, `model_id: depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Large-hf`, `input_size: 1400`. The lower weight matches the larger perceptor's higher gradient magnitude (see the depth-anchor section above).
- **Loss splitting:** `loss_split: diffusion_depth` on the dataset, so depth and diffusion fire on alternating optimizer steps.
- **Mask source: none.** Single-character cartoon images with white backgrounds don't need masking.

**Watching the depth anchor work.** Each preview tile shows (GT RGB | GT depth | Pred RGB | Pred depth) side by side. At the start of training the predicted depth is unstructured noise; by the end it tracks the GT depth closely.

**Early (step 21)** — `depth_consistency_loss: 26.6`

![Early preview](https://github.com/BuffaloBuffaloBuffaloBuffalo/ai-toolkit-perceptual/releases/download/examples-squidward-v1/preview_early.jpg)

**Late (step 1199)** — `depth_consistency_loss: 1.6`

![Late preview](https://github.com/BuffaloBuffaloBuffaloBuffalo/ai-toolkit-perceptual/releases/download/examples-squidward-v1/preview_late.jpg)

**Generalizing past the dataset.** The training image is a confident front-three-quarter pose. Generations from the trained LoRA hold the character identity in poses, framings, and contexts that don't exist in the source material:

| | |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Output 1](https://github.com/BuffaloBuffaloBuffaloBuffalo/ai-toolkit-perceptual/releases/download/examples-squidward-v1/output_1.png) | ![Output 2](https://github.com/BuffaloBuffaloBuffaloBuffalo/ai-toolkit-perceptual/releases/download/examples-squidward-v1/output_2.png) |

The first output is a near-direct front view, and there is no front-view reference anywhere in the source material, let alone the dataset. Both outputs maintain the character's distinctive identity (chiseled face, squid morphology, the specific drawn-on aesthetic) while placing him in contexts the LoRA wasn't trained on.

**Why it works.** From a single image, per-pixel diffusion MSE alone would just memorize the training photo. The depth anchor adds a structural objective that gets reinforced on the same one image, so the LoRA picks up a 3D-ish understanding of the character's shape that lets it interpolate to unseen angles. Loss splitting keeps the diffusion and depth gradients from interfering with each other, which dramatically reduces the texture burn-in that's the typical failure mode of one-shot LoRAs.

**To reproduce:**

```bash
python run.py examples/squidward/config.yaml
```

Edit `model.name_or_path` in the config to point at your local Flux 2 Klein checkpoint before running.

## Example: Yoshitaka Amano Style (small-dataset style LoRA)

A working example of depth-anchored fine-tuning on an **artist's style** rather than a specific subject, on a **small dataset** of 14 illustrations. Yoshitaka Amano is the illustrator behind the original Final Fantasy character art and a long-running body of solo watercolor portrait work. Flux 2 Klein 9B doesn't reproduce his look from a prompt alone — it defaults to generic anime or oil-paint stylings.

**The reference style.** One illustration from the dataset is shown below to give a feel for what the LoRA is asked to learn: loose ink linework, watercolor washes, ornate costuming, hair drawn as long flowing tendrils.

| ![Reference](https://github.com/BuffaloBuffaloBuffaloBuffalo/ai-toolkit-perceptual/releases/download/examples-amano-v1/dataset_reference.jpeg) |
|:---:|
| One of the 14 training illustrations. |

**The config.** Key settings (full config at `output/amano/config.yaml` after a run):

- **Network:** LoKr, linear/alpha 32, conv/alpha 16, full-rank, factor 8.
- **Steps:** 4000, batch size 1, gradient accumulation 2.
- **Resolution:** 768.
- **Depth anchor:** `loss_weight: 0.005`, `model_id: depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Large-hf`, `input_size: 1400`, `mask_source: none`.
- **Loss splitting:** `loss_split: diffusion_depth` on the dataset, so depth and diffusion fire on alternating optimizer steps.

**Watching the depth anchor work.** The ground-truth pair (RGB | depth) is shown once at the top; the predicted pair (RGB | depth) is shown for an early and late step at a comparable noise level. Early on, the predicted depth has heavy halo artifacts and doesn't track the figure cleanly; by the end of training it's a much closer match to the GT depth.

**Ground truth** (RGB | depth)

![Ground truth](https://github.com/BuffaloBuffaloBuffaloBuffalo/ai-toolkit-perceptual/releases/download/examples-amano-v1/preview_gt.jpg)

**Early prediction (step 383, t=0.82)** — `depth_consistency_loss: 17.17`

![Early prediction](https://github.com/BuffaloBuffaloBuffaloBuffalo/ai-toolkit-perceptual/releases/download/examples-amano-v1/preview_pred_early.jpg)

**Late prediction (step 3941, t=0.81)** — `depth_consistency_loss: 6.67`

![Late prediction](https://github.com/BuffaloBuffaloBuffaloBuffalo/ai-toolkit-perceptual/releases/download/examples-amano-v1/preview_pred_late.jpg)

**Generalizing past the dataset.** None of these subjects appear in the training set. The LoRA carries Amano's linework, color treatment, and composition language onto subjects from very different IPs:

| Cloud (FF7) | Snow White (Disney) | Ziggy Stardust (Bowie) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ![Cloud](https://github.com/BuffaloBuffaloBuffaloBuffalo/ai-toolkit-perceptual/releases/download/examples-amano-v1/output_cloud.png) | ![Snow White](https://github.com/BuffaloBuffaloBuffaloBuffalo/ai-toolkit-perceptual/releases/download/examples-amano-v1/output_snow.png) | ![Ziggy](https://github.com/BuffaloBuffaloBuffaloBuffalo/ai-toolkit-perceptual/releases/download/examples-amano-v1/output_ziggy.png) |

**Why depth anchoring matters here.** With a style dataset this small, the diffusion loss alone tends to overfit on the specific compositions of the training images — every output starts looking like a slight variation on the same handful of poses and figures. The depth anchor pushes the LoRA toward what's invariant across the artist's work (linework, paper texture, color treatment) and away from what's incidental (this exact figure, in this exact pose, against this exact background). Loss splitting reinforces the separation: the diffusion-step focuses on appearance, the depth-step on structure, and they only really agree on the high-level "this looks like Amano" signal.

## Configuration Reference

Every fork-specific config option, grouped by the YAML block it lives in. Defaults shown match what you get if you omit the option entirely.

### `depth_consistency.*`

The depth anchor.

| Option | Default | What it does, when to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `loss_weight` | `0.1` | Master switch. `0` disables. `0.1` is calibrated for DA2-Small (the default perceptor). Drop to ~`0.001` if you switch to DA2-Large, since it produces much higher-magnitude gradients. If outputs look washed-out or over-smoothed, halve the weight and retry. |
| `model_id` | `Depth-Anything-V2-Small-hf` | Which DA2 variant. Small is fast and adequate for most subjects. Base or Large give cleaner depth on cluttered scenes at higher VRAM cost. **Lower the loss weight when using a larger model** (Base ~`0.01`, Large ~`0.001`). |
| `mask_source` | `subject` | Which mask the loss applies through. `subject` is recommended for subject LoRAs (loss restricted to the person). `body` excludes clothing. `none` uses the full image. |
| `loss_min_t` | `0.0` | Lower edge of the timestep window where the depth anchor fires. |
| `loss_max_t` | `1.0` | Upper edge of the timestep window. Narrow to mid-high (e.g. `0.5` to `0.9`) to focus the anchor on the identity-encoding noise band. |
| `ssi_weight` | `1.0` | Scale-and-shift-invariant L1 term weight. Rarely needs tuning. |
| `grad_weight` | `0.5` | Multi-scale gradient term weight. Increase for more sensitivity to fine geometric structure. |
| `grad_scales` | `4` | Number of pyramid scales for the gradient term. Rarely needs tuning. |
| `input_size` | `518` | DA2 input resolution. Must be a multiple of 14. Can go up to `1400` for the clearest depth maps, at proportionally higher VRAM and compute cost. The default `518` is a good balance for most setups; bump to `714` or `980` if you want sharper depth on detailed scenes, or `1400` for the maximum the perceptor will accept. |
| `grad_checkpoint` | `true` | Gradient checkpointing through the perceptor for memory savings. Leave on unless you're on huge VRAM. |
| `preview_every` | `100` | Save a depth preview tile every N steps to `depth_previews/`. Set to 0 to disable. |
| `preview_min_t` | `0.0` | Only save previews at timesteps at or above this. |

### `face_id.*`

The identity-related anchor losses.

| Option | Default | What it does, when to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `face_model` | `buffalo_l` | InsightFace model used for face detection and embeddings. Don't change unless you have a specific reason. |

**Identity anchor** (the loss that keeps face recognizable):

| Option | Default | What it does, when to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `identity_loss_weight` | `0.0` | Master switch. Typical 0.01 to 0.1. Higher locks in face shape harder, but too high constrains expressions. |
| `identity_loss_min_t` | `0.0` | Timestep window lower edge. |
| `identity_loss_max_t` | `1.0` | Timestep window upper edge. |
| `identity_loss_min_cos` | `0.2` | Minimum face similarity for the loss to fire on a sample. Below this, the predicted x0 likely doesn't contain a recognizable face yet, so the loss is skipped to avoid hallucinating one. |
| `identity_metrics` | `false` | Log `id_sim` without applying the loss. Useful for measuring identity drift in vanilla runs as a baseline. |
| `identity_loss_use_average` | `true` | Compare against the dataset's average face embedding instead of per-image. More robust on diverse training sets. |
| `identity_loss_average_blend` | `0.0` | Blend per-image with dataset average. 0 = per-image only, 0.5 = midpoint, 1.0 = pure average. |
| `identity_loss_use_random` | `false` | Compare against a random embedding from the dataset each step. Useful for mixed-identity training. |
| `identity_loss_num_refs` | `0` | If > 0, compare against K random embeddings and use best match. |

**Body proportion anchor** (ViTPose bone-length ratios):

| Option | Default | What it does, when to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `body_proportion_loss_weight` | `0.0` | Master switch. Typical 0.1 to 0.2. Use on full-body subject LoRAs where body shape should stay recognizable across poses. |
| `body_proportion_loss_min_t` | `0.0` | Timestep window lower edge. |
| `body_proportion_loss_max_t` | `1.0` | Timestep window upper edge. |
| `body_proportion_include_head` | `false` | Include head-related ratios. Off by default since identity anchor handles the head better. |

**Face suppression** (the inverse anchor; tells the LoRA to *not* learn faces):

| Option | Default | What it does, when to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `face_suppression_weight` | `null` | Master switch. `null` = no suppression. `0.0` = zero face loss (don't learn faces at all). `0.5` = half. `1.0` = normal. Use `0.0` for style or clothing LoRAs trained on photos with people. |
| `face_suppression_expand` | `2.0` | Multiplier on the face bounding box. `1.0` = tight face box, `1.8-2.0` = full head coverage. |
| `face_suppression_soft` | `false` | Gaussian falloff at the box edges instead of a hard rectangle. Smoother but slightly more invasive. |

### `subject_mask.*`

Auto-masking pipeline.

| Option | Default | What it does, when to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Master switch. Set true to extract per-image masks at job start. |
| `body_close_radius` | `2` | Morphological closing on the body mask. Higher values fill gaps in limbs and hair (e.g. `5` for blurry photos) at the cost of boundary precision. Changing this invalidates cached masks. |
| `mask_dilate_radius` | `0` | Outer dilation on the subject mask. Useful when you want a padding margin around the subject. |
| `skin_bias` | `0.0` | Bias added to body-class logits where skin tone is detected. Set to 1-3 if your dataset has lots of exposed skin and SegFormer is mislabeling it as clothing. |
| `save_debug_previews` | `false` | Save preview tiles per image. The dataset-tools UI preflight does the same thing on demand. |
| `segformer_res` | `768` | SegFormer input resolution. Don't change unless you know what you're doing. |
| `cache_resolution` | `256` | Cached mask resolution. Higher = sharper at training time, more disk. |
| `yolo_ckpt`, `yolo_conf`, `sam_size`, `dtype`, `primary_only` | (defaults) | Detection / segmentation backend knobs. The defaults work for almost everyone. |

### `train.*` (fork-specific additions)

| Option | Default | What it does, when to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `reg_weight` | `1.0` | Multiplier on diffusion loss for reg samples. `1.0` (equal pull) is the sane default. Increase to 1.5-2.0 if reg isn't preserving the prior strongly enough. |
| `gradient_cosine_log_every` | `0` | Diagnostic. Every N optimizer steps, measure `cos(g_diffusion, g_depth)` and log the per-loss gradient norms. `0` disables. Use 50-100 to diagnose anchor conflicts without much overhead. |
| `min_denoising_steps` | `0` | Lower bound on the timestep sampler (0-999). The training loop only samples from `[min, max]`. Useful for focused training, e.g. `min=700, max=700` to train at one specific noise level. |
| `max_denoising_steps` | `999` | Upper bound on the timestep sampler. |

### Per-dataset overrides (`datasets[].*`)

Every entry in `datasets:` accepts these fork-specific overrides. `null` or omitted = inherit the global value.

| Option | What it does, when to use it |
|---|---|
| `is_reg` | Mark this dataset as a regularization set. Strips subject conditioning and turns off all perceptual anchors on its samples. |
| `loss_split: diffusion_depth` | Strongly recommended for most cases. Alternates diffusion and depth-anchor on this dataset's samples per optimizer step (rather than running both every step). |
| `depth_loss_weight` | Per-dataset override of the depth anchor's `loss_weight`. Set to `0` to fully disable the depth anchor for this dataset (skips perceptor compute on its samples). |
| `depth_loss_min_t` / `depth_loss_max_t` | Per-dataset depth-anchor timestep window. |
| `depth_model_id` | Per-dataset DA2 variant. Useful if one dataset has unusual geometry that benefits from Large while others stay on Small. |
| `identity_loss_weight` / `_min_t` / `_max_t` / `_min_cos` | Per-dataset identity-anchor controls. Stronger weights on portrait crops, weaker on full-body. |
| `body_proportion_loss_weight` / `_min_t` / `_max_t` | Per-dataset body-proportion controls. Useful for full-body shots where pose proportions matter. |
| `face_suppression_weight` | Per-dataset face suppression. Per-dataset takes priority over global. |
| `background_loss_weight` / `clothing_loss_weight` / `body_loss_weight` | Per-region diffusion weight scaling. Used when `subject_mask.enabled` is true. Set background low (e.g. 0.3) and body high (1.0) to tell the LoRA to focus on the subject. |
| `perceptual_restrict_to_body` | Restrict perceptual-anchor losses to the body mask region for this dataset. |

# AI Toolkit UI

<img src="https://ostris.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/toolkit-ui.jpg" alt="AI Toolkit UI" width="100%">

The AI Toolkit UI is a web interface for the AI Toolkit. It allows you to easily start, stop, and monitor jobs. It also allows you to easily train models with a few clicks. It also allows you to set a token for the UI to prevent unauthorized access so it is mostly safe to run on an exposed server.

## Running the UI

Requirements:
- Node.js > 18

The UI does not need to be kept running for the jobs to run. It is only needed to start/stop/monitor jobs. The commands below
will install / update the UI and it's dependencies and start the UI. 

```bash
cd ui
npm run build_and_start
```

You can now access the UI at `http://localhost:8675` or `http://<your-ip>:8675` if you are running it on a server.

## Securing the UI

If you are hosting the UI on a cloud provider or any network that is not secure, I highly recommend securing it with an auth token. 
You can do this by setting the environment variable `AI_TOOLKIT_AUTH` to super secure password. This token will be required to access
the UI. You can set this when starting the UI like so:

```bash
# Linux
AI_TOOLKIT_AUTH=super_secure_password npm run build_and_start

# Windows
set AI_TOOLKIT_AUTH=super_secure_password && npm run build_and_start

# Windows Powershell
$env:AI_TOOLKIT_AUTH="super_secure_password"; npm run build_and_start
```


## FLUX.1 Training

### Tutorial

To get started quickly, check out [@araminta_k](https://x.com/araminta_k) tutorial on [Finetuning Flux Dev on a 3090](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzGW_Kyermg) with 24GB VRAM.


### Requirements
You currently need a GPU with **at least 24GB of VRAM** to train FLUX.1. If you are using it as your GPU to control 
your monitors, you probably need to set the flag `low_vram: true` in the config file under `model:`. This will quantize
the model on CPU and should allow it to train with monitors attached. Users have gotten it to work on Windows with WSL,
but there are some reports of a bug when running on windows natively. 
I have only tested on linux for now. This is still extremely experimental
and a lot of quantizing and tricks had to happen to get it to fit on 24GB at all. 

### FLUX.1-dev

FLUX.1-dev has a non-commercial license. Which means anything you train will inherit the
non-commercial license. It is also a gated model, so you need to accept the license on HF before using it.
Otherwise, this will fail. Here are the required steps to setup a license.

1. Sign into HF and accept the model access here [black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)
2. Make a file named `.env` in the root on this folder
3. [Get a READ key from huggingface](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens/new?) and add it to the `.env` file like so `HF_TOKEN=your_key_here`

### FLUX.1-schnell

FLUX.1-schnell is Apache 2.0. Anything trained on it can be licensed however you want and it does not require a HF_TOKEN to train.
However, it does require a special adapter to train with it, [ostris/FLUX.1-schnell-training-adapter](https://huggingface.co/ostris/FLUX.1-schnell-training-adapter).
It is also highly experimental. For best overall quality, training on FLUX.1-dev is recommended.

To use it, You just need to add the assistant to the `model` section of your config file like so:

```yaml
      model:
        name_or_path: "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell"
        assistant_lora_path: "ostris/FLUX.1-schnell-training-adapter"
        is_flux: true
        quantize: true
```

You also need to adjust your sample steps since schnell does not require as many

```yaml
      sample:
        guidance_scale: 1  # schnell does not do guidance
        sample_steps: 4  # 1 - 4 works well
```

### Training
1. Copy the example config file located at `config/examples/train_lora_flux_24gb.yaml` (`config/examples/train_lora_flux_schnell_24gb.yaml` for schnell) to the `config` folder and rename it to `whatever_you_want.yml`
2. Edit the file following the comments in the file
3. Run the file like so `python run.py config/whatever_you_want.yml`

A folder with the name and the training folder from the config file will be created when you start. It will have all 
checkpoints and images in it. You can stop the training at any time using ctrl+c and when you resume, it will pick back up
from the last checkpoint.

IMPORTANT. If you press crtl+c while it is saving, it will likely corrupt that checkpoint. So wait until it is done saving

### Need help?

Please do not open a bug report unless it is a bug in the code. You are welcome to [Join my Discord](https://discord.gg/VXmU2f5WEU)
and ask for help there. However, please refrain from PMing me directly with general question or support. Ask in the discord
and I will answer when I can.

## Gradio UI

To get started training locally with a with a custom UI, once you followed the steps above and `ai-toolkit` is installed:

```bash
cd ai-toolkit #in case you are not yet in the ai-toolkit folder
huggingface-cli login #provide a `write` token to publish your LoRA at the end
python flux_train_ui.py
```

You will instantiate a UI that will let you upload your images, caption them, train and publish your LoRA

pip install --upgrade accelerate transformers diffusers huggingface_hub #Optional, run it if you run into issues
```
#### Modal:
- Run `pip install modal` to install the modal Python package.
- Run `modal setup` to authenticate (if this doesn’t work, try `python -m modal setup`).

#### Hugging Face:
- Get a READ token from [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and request access to Flux.1-dev model from [here](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev).
- Run `huggingface-cli login` and paste your token.

### 2. Upload your dataset
- Drag and drop your dataset folder containing the .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images and .txt files in `ai-toolkit`.

### 3. Configs
- Copy an example config file located at ```config/examples/modal``` to the `config` folder and rename it to ```whatever_you_want.yml```.
- Edit the config following the comments in the file, **<ins>be careful and follow the example `/root/ai-toolkit` paths</ins>**.

### 4. Edit run_modal.py
- Set your entire local `ai-toolkit` path at `code_mount = modal.Mount.from_local_dir` like:
  
   ```
   code_mount = modal.Mount.from_local_dir("/Users/username/ai-toolkit", remote_path="/root/ai-toolkit")
   ```
- Choose a `GPU` and `Timeout` in `@app.function` _(default is A100 40GB and 2 hour timeout)_.

### 5. Training
- Run the config file in your terminal: `modal run run_modal.py --config-file-list-str=/root/ai-toolkit/config/whatever_you_want.yml`.
- You can monitor your training in your local terminal, or on [modal.com](https://modal.com/).
- Models, samples and optimizer will be stored in `Storage > flux-lora-models`.

### 6. Saving the model
- Check contents of the volume by running `modal volume ls flux-lora-models`. 
- Download the content by running `modal volume get flux-lora-models your-model-name`.
- Example: `modal volume get flux-lora-models my_first_flux_lora_v1`.

## Dataset Preparation

Datasets generally need to be a folder containing images and associated text files. Currently, the only supported
formats are jpg, jpeg, and png. Webp currently has issues. The text files should be named the same as the images
but with a `.txt` extension. For example `image2.jpg` and `image2.txt`. The text file should contain only the caption.
You can add the word `[trigger]` in the caption file and if you have `trigger_word` in your config, it will be automatically
replaced. 

Images are never upscaled but they are downscaled and placed in buckets for batching. **You do not need to crop/resize your images**.
The loader will automatically resize them and can handle varying aspect ratios. 


## Training Specific Layers

To train specific layers with LoRA, you can use the `only_if_contains` network kwargs. For instance, if you want to train only the 2 layers
used by The Last Ben, [mentioned in this post](https://x.com/__TheBen/status/1829554120270987740), you can adjust your
network kwargs like so:

```yaml
      network:
        type: "lora"
        linear: 128
        linear_alpha: 128
        network_kwargs:
          only_if_contains:
            - "transformer.single_transformer_blocks.7.proj_out"
            - "transformer.single_transformer_blocks.20.proj_out"
```

The naming conventions of the layers are in diffusers format, so checking the state dict of a model will reveal 
the suffix of the name of the layers you want to train. You can also use this method to only train specific groups of weights.
For instance to only train the `single_transformer` for FLUX.1, you can use the following:

```yaml
      network:
        type: "lora"
        linear: 128
        linear_alpha: 128
        network_kwargs:
          only_if_contains:
            - "transformer.single_transformer_blocks."
```

You can also exclude layers by their names by using `ignore_if_contains` network kwarg. So to exclude all the single transformer blocks,


```yaml
      network:
        type: "lora"
        linear: 128
        linear_alpha: 128
        network_kwargs:
          ignore_if_contains:
            - "transformer.single_transformer_blocks."
```

`ignore_if_contains` takes priority over `only_if_contains`. So if a weight is covered by both,
if will be ignored.

## LoKr Training

To learn more about LoKr, read more about it at [KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS](https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS/blob/main/docs/Guidelines.md). To train a LoKr model, you can adjust the network type in the config file like so:

```yaml
      network:
        type: "lokr"
        lokr_full_rank: true
        lokr_factor: 8
```

Everything else should work the same including layer targeting.

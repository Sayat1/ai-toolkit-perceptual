class Rose(torch.optim.Optimizer):
    """Rose: Range-Of-Slice Equilibration optimizer.
    In loving memory of my mother, Rose Kieren.
    
    Copyright 2026 Matthew Everet Kieren. All Rights Reserved.
    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
    
    Rose rescales gradients using a per-slice `|max| - min` range
    computed by reducing all dimensions beyond the leading axis.
    Unlike Adam and other stateful optimizers, Rose maintains no
    per-parameter state between steps: no momentum buffers,
    variance estimates, or even step counters. Memory cost is
    parameters + gradients + working memory, nothing else.
    
    Args:
        params (iterable):
            Iterable of model parameters or parameter-group dictionaries.
        
        lr (float):
            --- Learning Rate ---
            
            The global step size. Because this optimizer uses range-based
            normalization rather than Adam's RMS-based normalization, the
            same `lr` value can correspond to very different effective
            update sizes. Tune `lr` independently rather than relying on
            Adam defaults.
        
        weight_decay (float or None, optional) [1e-4]:
            --- Decoupled Weight Decay ---
            
            A decoupled multiplicative weight-decay coefficient applied
            separately from the adaptive gradient step. It gently
            shrinks weights toward zero at each step and can help reduce
            overfitting. Set to `0` or `None` to disable it.
        
        wd_schedule (bool or float, optional) [False]:
            --- Schedule-Coupled Weight Decay ---
            
            Scales weight decay proportionally with the learning-rate
            schedule so that decay weakens as the learning rate drops,
            preventing it from overpowering small updates. The per-step
            factor becomes `1 - (lr / lr_ref) * weight_decay`.
            
            If `False`, standard decoupled weight decay is used.
            If `True`, `lr_ref` is the first available among
            `group["max_lr"]`, `group["initial_lr"]`, and the
            learning-rate passed at construction time.
            If a float is provided, it is used directly as `lr_ref`.
        
        centralize (bool, optional) [True]:
            --- Gradient Centralization ---
            
            Removes shared offsets from gradient slices before the range
            computation. This can improve generalization and training
            stability. Biases and other 1D parameters are not
            centralized.
        
        stabilize (bool, optional) [True]:
            --- Coefficient-of-Variation Trust Gating ---
            
            Computes a trust factor from the coefficient of variation of
            the per-slice range tensor, and then interpolates between the
            local range and a smoother global mean denominator. This can
            smooth noisy range estimates. Some models perform better with
            it enabled, others disabled; try both.
        
        bf16_sr (bool or torch.Generator, optional) [True]:
            --- Stochastic Rounding for BFloat16 ---
            
            Improves BF16 training by using stochastic rounding instead
            of plain truncation when writing parameters back. This has
            no effect on non-BF16 parameters.
            
            BF16 parameters are promoted to `compute_dtype` (or to FP32
            if `compute_dtype` is `None`) for the update and then
            cast to FP32 for write-back. The result is stochastically
            rounded by adding uniform noise to the lower 16 bits of the
            FP32 representation before truncation to BF16.
            
            If `False`, BF16 stochastic rounding is disabled.
            If `True`, uses the default random-number generator.
            If a `torch.Generator` is provided instead of a boolean,
            treats `bf16_sr` as enabled and forwards that generator
            to `random_`. This is useful when you want reproducible
            stochastic rounding noise.
        
        compute_dtype (torch.dtype, str, or None, optional) [fp64]:
            --- Internal Compute Precision ---
            
            Promotes parameters and gradients to this dtype for the
            update step, then casts them back on write-back. Setting this
            to `None` disables promotion and computes in each parameter's
            native dtype, except that BF16 parameters still use FP32 when
            `bf16_sr` is enabled.
            
            FP64 is recommended because the intermediate range and
            division arithmetic benefits from the extra precision.
            
            In addition to passing a `torch.dtype` or `None`, the
            following strings are also valid: `float16`, `fp16`,
            `bfloat16`, `bf16`, `float32`, `fp32`, `float64`, `fp64`,
            `none`, and `null`.
